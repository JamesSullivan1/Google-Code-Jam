Number of connections
=====================

In a full binary tree, each vertex has exactly 1 or 3 connections,
except a single root with 2 connections.

We can only remove leaves, ie vertices with 1 connection (their parent).

For each node with 2 connections, pretend that it is the root, and try
to trim its tree into a full binary tree. 

For trimming, we proceed recursively. For a given node, there are 3 
cases.

1) The node is a leaf (1 connection).
    Do not trim. Return 0.
2) The node is a connector (2 connections) distinct from the root.
    Trim it's child's subtree, returning that size.
3) The node is full.
    Return the number of trims needed in the left and right subtrees.

Return the minimum for all root selections.
