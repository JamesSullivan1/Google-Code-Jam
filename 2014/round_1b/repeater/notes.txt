Algorithm
=========

For each run of a specific character, match up the number of occurrences
of it in the cheapest way possible, and then move on to tne next run.
If at any point a character appears in one string that is not next in
the others, then we abort.

Example:

aab
abb

v      v      v     v     v
aab    ab    ab    ab   ab
abb    abb   abb   ab   ab
  Shrink      Shrink     Done  

aab
abc

v      v      v      v
aab    ab    ab    ab
abc    abc   abc   abc
  Shrink           FAIL

Matching all runs cheaply can be determined by finding the most common
run length and setting all other runs to it. The cost of this is the sum
of the differences from this most common run length.
