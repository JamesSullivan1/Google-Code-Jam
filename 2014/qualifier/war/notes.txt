1. Finding Ken's Optimal Strategy

Greedy Heuristic - Always select the smallest block that will win
against Naomi's choice. If Ken cannot win the round, select the smallest
block.

This means that Ken will win every round that he can, and will also win
in the most efficient way possible (ie, the margin that he wins by is
minimal for every round).

Example rounds:

Naomi: 0.1 0.25 0.4  0.7  0.3  (sum is 1.75)
Ken:   0.2 0.5  0.15 0.85 0.05 (sum is 1.75)

Turn    Naomi   Ken     Win
1       0.1     0.15    K 
2       0.25    0.5     K
3       0.4     0.85    K
4       0.7     0.05    N 
5       0.3     0.2     N

Ken wins 3-2 here.


Naomi: 2 4 6 8 10 (sum is 30)
Ken:   1 3 5 7 9  (sum is 25)

Turn    Naomi   Ken     Win
1       2       3       K
2       4       5       K
3       6       7       K
4       8       9       K
5       10      1       N

Ken wins 4-1 here (even though he has a smaller set of blocks).

2a. Finding Naomi's Optimal Counter-Strategy

Naomi has zero knowledge in this game and certainly has a disadvantage.
Her best strategy is to try to get rid of Ken's heavy blocks as fast as
she can, and hope that he runs out before she does so she can score some
points.

Her strategy is to select the heaviest block every time.

2b. Finding Naomi's Optimal Counter-Strategy (with cheating)

Naomi must ensure that the block that Ken selects will always be heavier
than what she claims, if he has such a block. Her goal is to exhaust his
big blocks.

Her strategy, then, is to use her lightest blocks to exhaust his
heaviest blocks, falsely claiming that hers are almost as heavy as his.

She only needs to do this for blocks that simply cannot win. So she
needs to find out if any of her blocks are useless, and burn those to
get rid of the highest value blocks Ken has.

So her algorithm is as follows:
1) Select the smallest element of ours that will beat the smallest
   element of theirs. Claim that our element costs EPSILON more than
   their heaviest element. They will play their minimal element, and
   we will win.
2) If no such element exists, just play our smallest element, but claim
   that it costs EPSILON less than their most expensive element. They
   will win but it will cost them this element.
