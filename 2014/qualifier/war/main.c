 * Problem
 *
 * Naomi and Ken sometimes play games together. Before they play, each
 * of them gets N identical-looking blocks of wood with masses between
 * 0.0kg and 1.0kg (exclusive). All of the blocks have different
 * weights. There are lots of games they could play with those blocks,
 * but they usually play something they call War. Here is how War works: 
 *
 * 1. Each player weighs each of his or her own blocks, so each player
 *    knows the weights of all of his or her own blocks, but not the
 *    weights of the other player's blocks. 
 *
 * 2. They repeat the following process N times:
 *
 *     1. Naomi chooses one of her own blocks, with mass ChosenNaomi.
 *     2. Naomi tells Ken the mass of the block she chose.
 *     3. Ken chooses one of his own blocks, with mass ChosenKen.
 *     4. They each put their block on one side of a balance
 *          scale, and the person whose block is heavier gets one
 *          point.
 *     5. Both blocks are destroyed in a fire.
 *
 * Naomi has realized three things about War. First, she has
 * realized that she loses a lot. Second, she has realized that
 * there is a unique strategy that Ken can follow to maximize
 * his points without assuming anything about Naomi's strategy,
 * and that Ken always uses it. Third, she has realized that
 * she hates to lose. Naomi has decided that instead of playing
 * War, she will play a game she calls Deceitful War. The great
 * thing about Deceitful War is that Ken will think they're
 * playing War!
 *
 * Here is how Deceitful War works, with differences between
 * Deceitful War and War in bold: 
 *
 * 1.  Each player weighs each of his or her own blocks. _Naomi also
 *     weighs Ken's blocks while he isn't looking, so Naomi knows the
 *     weights of all blocks_ and Ken only knows the weights of his own
 *     blocks. 
 *
 * 2. They repeat the following process N times: 
 *
 *     1. Naomi chooses one of her own blocks, with mass ChosenNaomi.
 *     2. Naomi tells Ken _a number, ToldNaomi, betweem 0.0kg and 1.0kg
 *        exclusive_, Ken, who thinks they're playing War, thinks the
 *        number Naomi just told him is ChosenNaomi.
 *     3. Ken chooses one of his own blocks, with mass ChosenKen.
 *     4. They each put their block on one side of a balance
 *          scale, and the person whose block is heavier gets one
 *          point.
 *     5. Both blocks are destroyed in a fire.
 *
 * Naomi doesn't want Ken to know that she isn't playing War; so when
 * she is choosing which block to play, and what mass to tell Ken, she
 * must make sure that the balance scale won't reveal that ChosenNaomi â‰ 
 * ToldNaomi. In other words, she must make decisions so that: 
 *
 * -ChosenNaomi > ChosenKen if, and only if, ToldNaomi > ChosenKen, and 
 *
 * It might seem like Naomi won't win any extra points by being
 * deceitful, because Ken might discover that she wasn't playing War;
 * but Naomi knows Ken thinks both players are playing War, and she
 * knows what he knows, and she knows Ken will always follow his
 * unique optimal strategy for War, so she can always predict what he
 * will play.
 *
 * You'll be given the masses of the blocks Naomi and Ken started with.
 * Naomi will play Deceitful War optimally to gain the maximum number
 * of points. Ken will play War optimally to gain the maximum number of
 * points assuming that both players are playing War. What will Naomi's
 * score be? What would it have been if she had played War optimally
 * instead?
